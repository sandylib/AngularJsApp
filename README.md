AngularJsApp
============

It has been build by using AngularJs and working with asp.net mvc as backend.

This is what I follow with one video in youtube.com https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja2xDrtylBw

It take me a while to figure out all of this. It works, so I put it here hope that could help other people.
